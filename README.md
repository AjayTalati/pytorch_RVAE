## pytorch Recurrent Variational Autoencoder
Generates sequential data

### Sampling examples:

- > u.s. government officials also said they would be willing to consider whether the proposal could be used as urging and programs

- > men believe they had to go on the \<unk> because their \<unk> were \<unk> expensive important

- > the companies insisted that the color set could be included in the program

python train_word_embeddings.py
```

### To train model use:

python train.py
```
